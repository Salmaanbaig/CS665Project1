The provided SQL commands create and populate a database named "House_Sales" with three tables: "bike", "ownerDetails", "oldownerDetails", and "Gov_details".

The "bike" table contains information about houses for sale, including House_Id, Area, Furnished_Details, House_type, and House_Price columns. The House_Id column is the primary key, and it has an auto-incrementing feature.

The "ownerDetails" table contains information about the owners of the houses for sale, including owner_Id, Area, Phone_Num, owner_name, and house_id columns. The owner_Id column is the primary key, and it also has an auto-incrementing feature. The house_id column is a foreign key referencing the House_Id column of the "bike" table.

The "oldownerDetails" table contains information about the previous owners of the houses for sale, including owner_Id, owner_address, Phone_Num, owner_name, and house_id columns. The owner_Id column is the primary key, and it also has an auto-incrementing feature. The house_id column is a foreign key referencing the House_Id column of the "bike" table.

The "Gov_details" table contains information about the government survey of the houses for sale, including OLD_owner_Id, current_owner_id, Survey_num, and house_id columns. The OLD_owner_Id and current_owner_id columns are foreign keys referencing the owner_Id column of the "oldownerDetails" and "ownerDetails" tables, respectively. The house_id column is a foreign key referencing the House_Id column of the "bike" table.

The database appears to be in third normal form (3NF) because each table has a primary key, and there are no repeating groups or transitive dependencies in the columns.
